## Features
- Secure Roommate Posting System <br>
Users can easily submit new roommate or room listings through a structured form. Each post is securely stored in the backend database, ensuring reliable data handling.

- User Authentication & Authorization <br>
With Firebase Authentication integrated, users can sign in and manage their own listings. Only logged-in users can create posts, adding a layer of security and accountability.

- My Listings Dashboard <br>
Each authenticated user has access to a personalized dashboard where they can view, manage, and delete the posts they’ve made — giving full control over their content.

- Contact-Based Roommate Communication <br>
Each post includes contact details like phone numbers or emails, enabling direct offline communication between interested parties to discuss room availability and terms.

- Deployed Full-Stack Architecture <br>
The frontend (React/Vite) is hosted on Firebase, while the backend (Node.js/Express) is deployed on Vercel. This separation ensures a clean full-stack setup and faster load times.

- Like Button Interaction <br>
Users can click a like button on posts, showing interest and allowing others to see how many users are interested in that listing — creating organic engagement.

- Individual Post Detail Page <br>
Each post links to a dedicated detail page that shows complete information about the room, rent, location, preferences, and contact details for better decision-making.

- All Posts Listing Page <br>
The platform features an "All Posts" page where users can browse every public listing, helping them discover available rooms and roommates easily.
